DISCORD LOG MONITOR
===================

A simple Node.js script that monitors a log file in real time and sends player connection and disconnection events to a Discord channel via webhook.

FEATURES
--------
- Parses log lines for `[MP] <player> connected` and `[MP] <player> disconnected` events
- Ignores Steam messages and chat lines
- Tracks the current number of players and displays it against a configurable maximum
- Resets state automatically when the log file is rewritten
- Prepends a ðŸš” emoji for player names starting with `PRF`
